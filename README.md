# Workshop-regex-Martin-Ferrand

For this workshop you don’t need any tool !
You will be able to test all regex (regular expressions) with the website regex101 (look it up!).
You will need to copy/paste the exercice and try to create a regex that do what you need.

#To be counted as having participated to the workshop you will have to send me at the end of the workshop on discord your name and a texte file (something that i can open easily to verify what you did) with all the regex that you have created !
